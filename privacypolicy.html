    <h1>Hem and Haw Privacy Policy</h1>   
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025/06/20</p>
    <hr>
        
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hem and Haw is a browser extension available on Firefox's <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/hem-and-haw/">add-on store</a>
        and Google Chrome's <a target="_blank" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hem-and-haw/cohhnfmlkkancdkcooidfhanchcjljbf">web store</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This extension detects and reports when hashes of your personally identifiable information (PII)—such as email addresses 
        and phone numbers—are being sent by websites you visit to third-parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of a University of Calgary study, we collect some data from users of our extension for research purposes.
    </p>
    <hr>


    <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>
            To provide functionality, the Hem and Haw browser extension asks for your PII such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Email addresses</li>
                <li>Phone numbers</li>
                <li>Dates of birth</li>
                <li>ZIP codes</li>
                <li>Other identifiers input by the user</li>
            </ul>
            
            The extension will calculate and save the corresponding hashes of the PII you provide to search for in network traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>All PII and corresponding hashes are stored locally</strong> in your browser. This data is <strong>never transmitted</strong> or shared.
        </p>
    <hr>

    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        For the purposes of our study, whenever Hem and Haw detects a website transmitting a hash of a PII identifier to a third-party,
        we collect:
        <ul>
            <li>the hostname of the website you visited (ex. example.com),</li>
            <li>the hostname of the third party (ex. trackingcompany.com),</li>
            <li>the type of PII being shared (ex. Email, Phone Number, Zip Code),</li>
            <li>the hash function used (ex. SHA256),</li>
            <li>whether you declared you use an adblock or not,</li>
            <li>how privacy-conscious you declare you are,</li>
            <li>where in the transmission (HTTP request) the hashed PII was found (ex. url, body, headers).</li>
        </ul> 

        This is triggered only when:
        <ol>
            <li>the Hem and Haw extension is enabled and actively searching for PII hash transmissions, and</li>
            <li>you inputted the PII whose corresponding hash was detected</li>
        </ol>

        These details are sent from the extension installed on your browser to our server. <strong>We do not record
        your IP address or any other identifying information.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, if you entered and submitted your Prolific ID on Hem and Haw, the extension will ping our server with your Prolific ID
        at most once daily. This is to keep track of Prolific participants who are actively using Hem and Haw throughout the week for bonus
        payment purposes. <strong>We do not record your IP address, any other identifying information. We also only record the date of the ping
        instead of a full timestamp.
        </strong> 
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
        Your local extension data (including the PII your provide and its hashes) is stored using the browser's built-in local storage (e.g., <code>browser.storage.local</code>).
        This means:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>This data never leaves your device</strong></li>
        <li>You can delete all locally stored data by removing the extension or clearing browser storage</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The non-identifying research data we collect is stored in a protected server at the University of Calgary. 
        <strong>We do not:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Send any personal or sensitive data to external servers</li>
        <li>Share your data with third parties</li>
        <li>Identify or attempt to identify you uniquely</li>
        <li>Track or attempt to track you across websites</li>
        <li>Sell, rent, or trade your information</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Your Control</h2>
    <p>
        You may delete your hashed PII transmission logs by:
        <ul>
            <li>Opening Hem and Haw -> See all results -> Clear your data, or</li>
            <li>Deleting your entire browsing history (this will trigger the deletion of the logs)</li>
        </ul>

        You may delete your provided PII and its hashes by:
        <ul>
            <li>Opening Hem and Haw and deleting individual PII fields or clicking the Clear button</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
