      <h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h2>

      <div class="why-section">
        <h3>What is hashing?</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" target="_blank">Hash functions</a> are one-way mathematical transformations used to convert plain text into a seemingly random output.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the SHA-256 hash of <code>hello</code> is: <br>
          <code>2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824</code>
        </p>

        <h3>What do companies do with hashing?</h3>
        <p>
          Your personally identifiable information (PII), such as email addresses and phone numbers, is often requested by websites and shared with third-party companies 
          for advertising and analytics. To comply with privacy regulations, many websites claim to <em>“anonymize”</em> this data by applying hash functions before sharing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          While hashing can serve legitimate security purposes, extensive research 
          <span title="Demir et al. 2018">
            <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8023740/" target="_blank">[1]</a>
          </span>
          <span title="Marx et al. 2018">
            <a href="https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/16294" target="_blank">[2]</a>
          </span>
          has shown it to be ineffective for PII anonymization. 
          Many types of hashed PII can be easily reversed, especially when based on predictable data like phone numbers or email addresses. 
          This allows third parties to re-identify users, undermining the privacy protections these sites claim to offer.
        </p>

        <h3>What does Hem and Haw do?</h3>
        <p>
          Hem and Haw is a browser extension that detects and reports when websites are transmitting your hashed PII to third-parties by comparing outgoing web traffic
          against hashed versions of data you provide (like your email or phone number).

        <p>
          The extension runs silently in the background as you browse. For research purposes, it collects <strongonly>metadata</strong> about when and where 
          hashed personal identifiers appear in web requests — for example, which websites include them and which companies collect them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your actual personal information and its hashes <strong>never leave your device</strong>. 
          The extension stores and processes that data locally, using it only to check if it appears in outgoing traffic. 
          What we receive is anonymized and stripped of any identifying details.
        </p>


        <h3>How do I use Hem and Haw?</h3>
        <p>Once you have installed Hem and Haw on your browser, click on the extension icon to open the popup. 
          You will then enter your personal information (such as email addresses, phone numbers, etc.) into Hem and Haw. You can add, remove, and modify fields.
          </p>  
          
          <p>
          Then, when ready, click the <em>Submit</em>  button. The extension will then automatically scan your network traffic for instances of websites sending hashes 
            of your personal information to third parties. These instances will be reported in a log which you can view using the <em>See all results</em> button.</p>

          <p>
            As part of our study, the extension popup will ask you how privacy-conscious you are and whether you use an adblock tool or not. Please answer those questions.

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq">
            <details>
            <summary>How do I install Hem and Haw?</summary>
            <p>You can install it from the Firefox extension store for free <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/hem-and-haw">here</a>.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
            <summary>What kind of data is collected?</summary>
            <p>As part of this University of Calgary study, whenever a PII hash transmission to a third-party is detected, Hem and Haw will send us the following:
              <ul>
                <li>the hostname of the website you visited (ex. example.com),</li>
                <li>the hostname of the third party (ex. trackingcompany.com),</li>
                <li>the type of PII being shared (ex. Email, Phone Number, Zip Code),</li>
                <li>the hash function used (ex. SHA256),</li>
                <li>whether you declared you use an adblock or not,</li>
                <li>how privacy-conscious you declare you are,</li>
                <li>where in the transmission (HTTP request) the hashed PII was found (ex. url, body, headers).</li>
              </ul> 
            </p>
            </details>

            <details>
            <summary>How does Hem and Haw protect my privacy?</summary>
            <p>
              We will <strong>never</strong> collect your inputted personal information or your hashed data. Additionally, we do not record your IP address or any other
              identifying information.
            </p>
            </details>

            <details>
            <summary>Can I see my results?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes, you can see the hashed PII transmissions detected by Hem and Haw. Simply click on the "See all results" button in the Hem and Haw extension popup.
            </p>
            </details>

            <details>
            <summary>Can I delete my results?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes, you may delete your hashed PII transmission logs by:
              <ul>
                  <li>Opening Hem and Haw -> See all results -> Clear your data, or</li>
                  <li>Deleting your entire browsing history (this will trigger the deletion of the logs)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            </details>


            <details>
            <summary>Does Hem and Haw block hashed PII transmissions to third parties?</summary>
            <p>
              No, currently the extension does not block these hash transmissions, it only detects them.
            </p>
            </details>

            <details>
            <summary>Do I have to use Prolific?</summary>
            <p>Using Prolific is optional. If you want to get paid for participating, we use your Prolific ID to track your usage of Hem and Haw and to issue payments.
            Your Prolific ID will not be associated with your transmission
            data.
