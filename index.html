        <h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Why this matters</strong></h2>
        <h3>What is hashing?</h3>
        Hash functions are one-way mathematical transformations often used to convert a plaintext input into a seemingly random output.
        <br>
       
        For example, the SHA256 hash of <code>hello</code> is <code>2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824</code>
